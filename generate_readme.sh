# Mad Useful (madu) - Code Analysis Tool

> [!WARNING]
> This tool is always under active development and is just a mash up of various tiny static analysis features tools that have been useful to me over the years. Use at your own risk!


A fast, parallel code analysis tool that provides comprehensive codebase metrics and tracks changes over time. Built for speed with parallel processing and designed for developers who need quick insights into code complexity, file size, git history, and development patterns.

## Key Features

- **Lightning fast** - Parallel processing with Rayon for instant results
- **Comprehensive metrics** - Lines, complexity, density, size, indentation depth
- **Git integration** - Churn analysis, ownership tracking, commit patterns  
- **Smart filtering** - Regex patterns, thresholds, noise reduction
- **Real-time monitoring** - Watch mode for continuous analysis
- **Clean output** - Colored visualization with plain text option

## Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/drbh/mad-useful.git
cd mad-useful
cargo build --release

# Or install directly
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze current directory
madu

# Analyze specific directory with top 10 results
madu --top 10 src/

# Find complexity hotspots
madu --hotspots --top 5 src/

# Monitor changes in real-time
madu --watch 5 src/
```
